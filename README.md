# Welcome!
## LibreCode Annotation Tool
An [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)-based coding session annotator aimed at training an LLM to assist at a deeper level within debugging sessions.

## Background
LLMs such as ChatGPT rely heavily on articles and code commits rather than the ever-evolving context of a coding session which consist of attempts, failures, successes, screen switching, and so on. So, the goal here is to enrich the training data of an LLM by providing it with a more dynamic and real-time coding session data.

## Features
- upload an asciinema recording
- annotate the recording with comments
- export the annotated recording as a new asciinema recording

## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
